This repository contains source code and slides for the talk "Efficient machine learning" at R/Pharma 2024. The **slides** for the talk are available [here](https://simonpcouch.github.io/rpharma-24).

This talk is based on the introductory chapter to my forthcoming book "Efficient machine learning with R." You can check out the current draft at [emlwr.org](https://emlwr.org).

To learn more about machine learning with R:

-   Machine learning with tidymodels: [tmwr.org](https://tmwr.org)
-   More example notebooks with tidymodels are at [tidymodels.org](https://tidymodels.org).

In this repository,

-   `index.qmd` contains the source code for the slides. The slides use images in the `/figures` directory.
-   `/docs` is auto-generated from `index.qmd`. Content in that folder is likely unhelpful for a human reader, and is better viewed at the links above. :)
